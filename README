jpack
========

* Pack your Joomla! Extensions with ease
* Check PHP Syntax before zipping

To run: `jpack directory`. 

`jpack` will check the syntax of all php files in `directory` and then zip your directory to create `directory.zip`

**WARNING:** If you run `jpack directory` and already have a zip file named `directory.zip` then `jpack` will overwrite that file. Be careful!

`jpack` will not zip files matching the following patterns:

* \*.svn*
* \*.git*
* \*.DS_Store
* exclude.lst
